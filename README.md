# Capstone---Melbourne-Parking-Data-2011
Final year capstone project for RMIT University running data analytics and answering research questions based on findings on the 2011 Melbourne parking data. Project was done with a group of 4 people. The primary focus of the project was to find interesting relations among the features of the dataset as well as to see if the machine can predict three things which are-
1. Whether a particular event will result in an infringment or not
2. The time of the Infringement 
3. The place of the infringement

The questions were solved using classification based algorithms and the accuracy score of each algorithm was compared to see which one did the best. Some recommendations were also made based on the findings. The details of the methodology, procedure and outcomes are recorded in the report.
